This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  It's subtle and can be hard to track down. The issue stems from not properly removing observers when they are no longer needed, especially in view controllers that are deallocated. If an observer is not removed and the observed object is deallocated, attempting to access the object from the observer will cause a crash. This is often masked by the fact that many things might continue to work until a specific event fires.
